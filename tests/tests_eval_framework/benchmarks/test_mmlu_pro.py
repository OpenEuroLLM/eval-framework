"""Specification of the composed MMLU-Pro tasks.

Each spec test builds the real benchmark over one fictional row and asserts the assembled sample — so this
file reads as MMLU-Pro's prompt spec, with ``composed.py`` an implementation detail. The subject label comes
from the evaluated subject (a category); the reader takes the options as-is. ``test_formatter_hash`` pins the
variants against the real HuggingFace data. The loglikelihood variants deliberately score a fixed ten letters
A–J even when a question lists fewer options (a preserved MMLU-Pro quirk); the spec below shows that.
