"""Specification of the composed GPQA tasks.

Each spec test builds the real benchmark over one fictional row and asserts the assembled sample — so this
file reads as GPQA's prompt spec, with ``composed.py`` an implementation detail. GPQA shuffles the correct
answer in among the distractors, seeded from the option texts, so the fictional row below has a fixed,
reproducible option order. ``test_formatter_hash`` pins every variant against the real (gated) HuggingFace
data — it needs Hugging Face auth (the CI hashing job provides a token).
