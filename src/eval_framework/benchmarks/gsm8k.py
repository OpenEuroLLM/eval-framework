"""GSM8K: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k

Grade-school math word problems. Both registered variants use eight fixed, hand-written exemplars (not
sampled from the dataset) and OLMES answer normalisation:

- ``GSM8K_OLMES``: free-form completion, scored on the final number of the generation.
- ``GSM8KBPB``: bits-per-byte of the single normalised gold solution (one forward pass).
